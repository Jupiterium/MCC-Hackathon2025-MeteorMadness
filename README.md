# MCC-Hackathon2025-MeteorMadness
A group of students focusing on the Meteor Madness challenge, which will mostly be implemented through Unity, leaving room for some calculations happening in Python/other backend tool. Our main focus is making science easy to understand through visuals, rather than heavy detail ðŸ‘¾

Team Members: 5
